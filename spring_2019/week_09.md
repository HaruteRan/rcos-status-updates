## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I finished implementing the basic functions, including user login, view user information,\
> add a course, course search, and switch between screens. Fixed bugs.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, I plan to work on UI layout design and background images design. Prepare for presentation.\
> If I could finish previous tasks, I will try to fix a difficult bug, which is related to python source code.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The implementation of core function went well. But I had a serious and difficult bug in switching screens.\
> The bug shows error massage: "weekly reference are no longer avaliable". The application worked fine\
> if I delete the 'create time slot' function, but I don't think this function can lead to this bug.
