## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I searched for methods of application development using C# or JAVA. I tried to get familiar with Visual Studio, \
> including manage project, testing, and write interface between C# and C++.\
> Also, we wrote the basic data structure of calendar using C++.\

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, we plan to finish implementing the basic functions of calendar, including create an event and read from calendar. \
> After finish the implementation, I will try to make a windows application for it.\
> Allow uses to using the appliction to create and read an event.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I did not have any experience and knowledge in application development. I am more familiar with C than JAVA.\
> So, I prefer writing the application in C# instead of JAVA, but according to my research, JAVA is more widely used.\
> Thus, I may need to spend more time learning and getting familiar with JAVA.

## Notes

> I had some experience working with Unity. I think I am able to make an appliction using C# and unity.\
> Not sure if this is a good idea.
