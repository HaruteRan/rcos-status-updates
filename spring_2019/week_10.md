## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I prepared for presentation and did some documentation work for our project.\
> I tried to fix the critical bug in my program but not done yet.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, I plan to finish my documentation work, and work on that bug as well.\
> It is not very likely to write in another way and I think the current structure should work.\

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The implementation of core function went well. But I had a serious and difficult bug in switching screens.\
> The bug shows error massage: "weekly reference are no longer avaliable". The application worked fine\
> if I delete the 'create time slot' function, but I don't think this function can lead to this bug.
