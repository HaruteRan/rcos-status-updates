## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, we did not have any progress in coding. We discussed about the future plan because \
> this is a start-up program. We had a brief idea and concepts in user and system logic. \
> Also, we studied the demo program of Kivy, but have many confusing points.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, we plan to study demo program of Kicy, and solve our confusion. Then we will start to build\
> our own application demo. \

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Last week, we decide to use Kivy in Python. However, the demo program it provides have lots of things\
> that we cannot understant. Because we did not have small group meeting in the past week, no actual progress\
> was made. We will ask professor about this next week.
