## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, do some researches on application development and UI design, especially on which program language\
> might be better in application design. I choose Kivy libarary in Python to program the application becuase I am \
> more familiar with Python compare to Java. In my research, I found that the old plan usng C# is not a very efficient\
> way.\
> The basic datastructure for the calendar is complete.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, we plan to make some add-on functions to the calendar and improve the core program.\
> Also, we will make some application demos using Kivy and Python.\
> We will do some research on how to connect datastructure written in C++ and application written in Python.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> As we change the programming language of application from C# to Python, this week's work is mainly researches \
> and learning. No critical blocking for this week.
