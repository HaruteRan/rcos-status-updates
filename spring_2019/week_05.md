## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I created multiple new screens for the application, and did some design work on it.\
> The application has the calendar structures and an input screen now.\
> However, the application still contrains many bugs. So, I haven't updated it on github yet.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, I plan to fix bugs in the application configures and try to make it work. \
> If I could fix them in this week, I plan to add event buttons to the calendar structure.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> No technical blocking. But because everything in application development is new to me,\
> the process is very slow.
