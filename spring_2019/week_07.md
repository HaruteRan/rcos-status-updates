## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I worked on UI design work of the calendar page and user input page.\
> I also looked into Google Clous Platform and try to implement the online function.\
> However, the application still contrains many bugs and cannot complie correctly. So, I haven't updated it on github yet.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week, I plan to look into the implement of database and core function.\
> And also optimize the UI design.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> No actual blocking. But we changed programming language many times, which makes the whole process very slow.
> We decided not to implement the online function, but finish the core function for now.
